"LS" is the spectral data of the light source in the experiment.

"OS" is the spectral data of the overlapping spectra in the experiment.

"Ra" is the reflectance of each FBG.

"Wa" is the wavelength of each FBG.

"FWHM" is the FWHM of each FBG.

Please run "Generate_traindata" to generate training data.

The function "sgwc" is used to calculate all possible wavelength combinations.

The function "AS_calculate" is used to calculate spectral overlap data for different wavelength combinations.

Since the training dataset is large (approximately 15 GB), the folder does not contain the dataset data used in the paper. 
You can generate your own training data using the "Generate_traindata" program as needed, 
or contact the author to request the training dataset.
